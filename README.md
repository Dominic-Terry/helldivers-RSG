# Helldivers Random Stratagem Generator

A small little Github page to randomly choose 1-4 stratagems for your next helldive :)

There is likely some bias towards certain stratagems simply due to the tree-like decisions it takes when selecting stratagems, but it shouldnt make a massive difference and i certainly dont care enough to work it out lol.

I'll always accept criticism, but be aware this was a simple evening project to keep me occupied, and give me a little more variety when it came to my games, I'm not sure if ill update it / improve the UI later on, who knows - but dont expect me to be working on this every dat going forth - otherwise feel free ot use / fork / take inspiration from it, it could certainly be tidied up & improved upon!

UNLICENCE attached, feel free to distrubute, copy, fork, or whatever. I own none of the assets used in `./assets` and all we're taken directly from the Helldivers 2 wiki (https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Helldivers_2).
